# CFD-Supersonic-Flow-in-Converging-Diverging-Nozzle-Using-ANSYS-Fluent
This repository simulates supersonic flow in a converging-diverging nozzle using ANSYS Fluent, focusing on calculating the exit pressure, Mach number, and temperature distribution to achieve supersonic flow at the nozzle exit. Results are validated with hand calculations.
